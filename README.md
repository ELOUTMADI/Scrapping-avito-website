# Scrapping-avito-website

We did the scrapping using the beautiful soup library on the avito.com website. We got a lot of information about its uses.

After the data was collected, we started to clean the data for analysis.

The visualization of some statistics on the information retrieved (Total number of announcements, number of announcements by category, number of announcements by city, announcement with information of the telephone number, ...).

You can find the cleaning code on python and some pictures that I got after the visualization .
